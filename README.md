### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my page!
I'm Nicholas, an ecological physiologist from <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/330/330301.svg" width="13"/> **Aotearoa, New Zealand**, currently living in <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/330/330188.svg" width="13"/> **Sydney, Australia**.

I am an early-career researcher with an interest in the diversity of form and function from an ecological and evolutionary framework. Specifically, I am interested in how changing environments constrain the physiology and life history of organisms, and understanding the mechanisms for how animals cope and adapt to environmental stressors.

My research primarily utilises vertebrate ectotherms like <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/2219/2219706.svg" height="14"/> reptiles, <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/1864/1864502.svg" width="14"/> amphibians, and <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/1134/1134431.svg" width="14"/> fish as model systems, and I approach my research from an integrative viewpoint, from cellular to whole-organism level responses, and incorporating them to mechanistic models to forecast geographic limitations and improving our capacity to predict the impact of climate change.

I have an outstanding publication record, with publications in leading high-impact journals such as *[Global Change Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652486)*, and regularly in the top journal in my field, the *[Journal of Experimental Biology](https://jeb.biologists.org/)*. I am also experienced with digital illustrations and designs, where I incorporate them to communicate my research to both the scientific and public community.
